# ga-opencv-python
GPU Accelerated (using CuPy) Computer Vision functions that mimic the OpenCV API.

# ⚠️  Work In Progress ⚠️
This is a personal project, and OpenCV functions will be built out as-needed.

TODO: Post graphs (w/ GPU stats) and savings

# Running Tests
Running single test files directly:
```
cd $REPOSITORY_ROOT
python -m unittest tests/test_calib3d.py
```
Helper script to run all test files:
```
python -m runtests
```
